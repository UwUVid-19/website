<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>To members of the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this Senate inquiry. Below you will find a submission related to the COVIDSafe application. We are doing seperate submissions on a per-topic basis.</p> 

<p>Members from the <a href="https://covidsafe.watch/">https://covidsafe.watch/</a> community are available to give in-person evidence to future public (or private) hearings by video conference.</p>

<p>We would appreciate a confirmation of the receipt of this submission and welcomes any feedback you may have.</p> 

<p><a href="https://covidsafe.watch/">https://covidsafe.watch/</a> is an online community backed by a team of security researchers, open-source software engineers, community managers and privacy specialists that support the concept of technology based contact tracing.</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to see lives saved through the use of this unprecedented technology.</li>
<li>It is crucial to us that privacy and security issues are addressed promptly and communicated in an inclusive and open manner.</li>
<li>We believe transparency is essential to achieve both of these goals without compromising either. Compromising privacy risks people’s lives by undermining public trust in the systems built to protect them.</li>
<li>This can only be achieved by direct collaboration with engineers using transparent open source platforms as done by the UK National Health Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>🙌 I'm Geoff, the probono open-source software engineer leading the independent analysis of <a href="https://covidsafe.gov.au/">covidsafe</a> via studying the source code. Software that I maintain is inside Microsoft Visual Studio, GitHub, Atlassian Sourcetree, Amazon Drive, Halo, Slack, is heavily used by the financial services industry and has been installed by other software developers over 21 million times.</p>

<p>I'm a hybrid hardware and software developer, with current professional experience with open-source development and designing/developing BLE-based products for <a href="https://georgerobotics.com/">George Robotics</a>. Formerly worked in programming/electronics education at Grok Learning, and before that at Google Australia as a tech lead in the SRE team as well as some time working with the Android team.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u5a5ersKBH6eG362atALrzuXo3zuZ70qrGomWVEC27U/edit">Bluetooth research</a> into contact tracing has received world wide praise. I discovered a <a href="https://github.com/alwentiu/COVIDSafe-CVE-2020-12856">Bluetooth security vulrunability</a> (CVE-2020-12856) that which requires goverments to modify their technological approaches and programs of work.</p>

<p>I'm a professional software engineer of 16 years, 8 of which have been in mobile app development and leadership. I have a strong interest in infosec, and my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sviVey1jCk97BACwkAJMctG8rFlC7Mf8pMpluW6VOQw/edit">research into the iPhone application background behaviour</a> identified a coding error as a contributing factor preventing COVIDSafe from working effectively. I discovered a <a href="/issue-register/cve-2020-12717-ios-bluetooth-denial-of-service">denial of service vulnerability</a> (CVE-2020–12717) in COVIDSafe.</p>

<p>Android 5.0 Lollipop was launched by Google back in late 2014 preceded by 5.1 Lollipop in early 2015. As of April 2020 both run on 2.64% of Australia’s Android Devices which make 55% of the wider Market. (Source) The COVIDSafe app has found to have an unneeded compatibility with those devices as it’s minimum version supported is 6.0.</p>
<p>Android 5.0 introduced the functionality of Bluetooth Low Energy Broadcasts, which is what the COVIDSafe app uses to emit the identifiers. The method used to code this functionality in the COVIDSafe app should run without a problem on both Android 5.0 &amp; 5.1.</p>
<p>The other thing is that the libraries (Sets of prewritten code) that are available to the public of which the COVIDSafe app is dependent upon are compatible with Android 5.0.</p>

<p>One item that no one in the community can figure out is the closed source (meaning private) library called “com.atlassian.mobilekit” of which the COVIDSafe app is dependent upon. There is speculation that since the COVIDSafe app is dependent on this library, that it is forced to make the minimum version 6.0.
Atlassian, the creators of this library, could potentially make a derivative that works on 5.0 &amp; 5.1 devices.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation Agency is working with Apple and Google on their improved bluetooth connectivity to implement into the COVIDSafe app. As of the preliminary documentation released by Google in April describing how this technology works on Android, it has outlined the minimum Android version required would be 5.0.</p>
<p>If there are no issues with dependencies that the COVIDSafe app is reliant upon, the modification to the code is not difficult. Simply adjust the “minSdkVersion” number from 23 to 21.
This small change could enable the COVIDSafe app to reach that 3% that might really need it.</p>
